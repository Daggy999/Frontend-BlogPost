                        you're lucky if
                        you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call her
                        Karma (come back). Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run away
                        and don't ever look back, don't ever look back.

                    <p> I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna be a victim ready for abduction.
                        She's got that international smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you ever
                        feel, feel so paper thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your

                        your Mustang to Radiohead. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot
                        we'll melt your popsicle. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy.

                        extraterrestrial. Talk about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.
